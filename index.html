                <p>ChatGPT was developed by OpenAI, an AI and research company, and was made available on November 30, 2022. ChatGPT is a natural language processing tool powered by AI technology that enables you to have conversations with the chatbot that are similar to those you would have with a human being while also doing much more (Ortiz). 
                    ChatGPT is a piece of machine learning software that creates responses to text-based inputs that resemble those of a human. Language translation, text summarization, question answering, creative writing, content development, code problem correction, and test passing in disciplines like law and business administration are just a few of the jobs that ChatGPT can complete. It has gained popularity among professionals and students due to its capacity to comprehend natural language questions and offer responses that resemble those of humans. Due to training on a larger and more varied dataset, ChatGPT-4, which will be launched in March 2023, is said to be more powerful and capable of carrying out complex functions.
                    ChatGPT works to generate highly human-like responses to a wide range of topics and world issues. It is highly intelligent in many areas of life spanning from culture to facts and statistics. As a result, professionals in education are anticipating major changes to the way students learn. On this site, we seek to answer the question: how does education best adapt to ChatGPT?
